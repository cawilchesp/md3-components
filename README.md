# MD3 Components

This repository contains a collection of Material Design 3 components built using PyQt6 library. PyQt6 is a set of Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, which allows Python programmers to create graphical applications with a native look and feel on a variety of platforms.

The Material Design 3 components in this repository are designed to be used in desktop applications, and include widgets such as buttons, text fields, sliders, and more. These components are customizable and can be used to create modern and intuitive user interfaces.

## Installation

To use the components in this repository, you must have PyQt6 installed. You can install PyQt6 using pip:

```
pip install PyQt6
```

## Usage

To use the components in your PyQt6 application, simply import the component class from the relevant module and use it in your code. For example, to use a material design button, you would import the `MDButton` class from the `mdbutton` module:

```python
from materialdesign3 import mdbutton
